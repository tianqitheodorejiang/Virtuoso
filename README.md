# Virtuoso
AI musician using a hierarchical approach that combines LSTM and CNNs in order to synthesize realistic instrumental music. The current version of Virtuoso features a model that is trained on over 100 hours of professional violin playing and is able to turn arbitrary MIDI inputs (pitch and length data) into convincing audio of instrumental violin music.

The frontend of Virtuoso is built using Qt Creator. We have built a downloadable software wrapper around the neural network which features an application interface that allows users to input and edit MIDI files before synthesizing violin audio through our application.
